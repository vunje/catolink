<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­­na­­ger of the new Im­­pe­­ri­al Res­­tau­­rant on the Tha­­mes Em­­bank­­ment went
in­­to his lu­­xu­­ri­ous pri­­va­­te of­­fi­­ce and shut the do­or. Ha­­ving do­­ne so, he
first scrat­­ched his chin re­­flec­­ti­­vely, and then to­ok a let­­ter from the
drawer in whi­­ch it had re­­po­­sed for mo­­re than two mon­­ths and pe­­ru­­sed it
ca­­re­­fully. Though he was not awa­­re of it, this was the thir­­ti­e­­th ti­­me he
had re­ad it sin­­ce bre­ak­­fast that mor­­ning. And yet he was not a whit
ne­a­­rer un­­ders­­tan­­ding it than he had been at the be­­gin­­ning. He tur­­ned it
over and scru­­ti­­ni­­zed the back, whe­­re not a sign of wri­­ting was to be
seen; he held it up to the win­­dow, as if he might ho­­pe to dis­­co­­ver
so­­me­­thing from the wa­­ter-­­mark; but the­­re was no­­thing in ei­­ther of the­­se
pla­­ces of a na­­tu­­re cal­­cu­­la­­ted to set his trou­­bled mind at rest. Then he
to­ok a mag­­ni­­fi­­cent re­­pe­a­­ter wat­­ch from his waist­­co­at pocket and glan­­ced
at the di­al; the hands sto­od at half-­­past se­­ven. He im­­me­­di­a­­tely threw
the let­­ter on the ta­­ble, and as he did so his an­­xi­ety found re­­li­ef in words.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s re­ally the most ex­­tra­or­­di­­nary af­­fair I ever had to do wi­­th,” he
re­­marked. “And as I’­­ve been in the bu­­si­­ness just three-and-­­thirty ye­ars
at ele­­ven a.m. next Mon­­day mor­­ning, I ought to know so­­me­­thing about it.
I only ho­­pe I’­­ve do­­ne righ­t, that’s all.”</p>  <p>As he spoke, the chi­ef bo­okkee­per, who had the tre­ble ad­van­ta­ge of being
tall, pretty, and just eigh­t-and-twenty ye­ars of age, en­te­red the ro­om.
She no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the lo­ok upon her chi­ef’s fa­ce, and her
cu­ri­o­sity was pro­por­ti­o­na­tely ex­ci­ted.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You se­em wor­­ri­ed, Mr. McP­­her­­son,” she said ten­­derly, as she put down
the pa­­pers she had brought in for his ­­sig­­na­­tu­­re.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You ha­­ve just hit it, Miss O’­­Sul­­li­­van,” he answe­­red, pushing them
far­­ther on to the ta­­ble. “I am wor­­ri­ed about many things, but
par­­ti­­cu­­larly about this ­­let­­ter.”</p>  <p>He han­ded the epis­tle to her, and she, being de­si­rous of im­pres­sing him
wi­th her bu­si­ness ca­pa­bi­li­ti­es, re­ad it wi­th os­ten­ta­ti­ous ca­re. But it
was no­ti­ce­a­ble that when she re­a­ched the sig­na­tu­re she too tur­ned back
to the be­gin­ning, and then de­li­be­ra­tely re­ad it over again. The ma­na­ger
ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pi­e­ce, and rang for the he­ad wai­ter. Ha­ving
re­li­e­ved his fee­lings in this way, he se­a­ted him­self again at his
wri­ting-­ta­ble, put on his glas­ses, and sta­red at his com­pa­ni­on, whi­le
wai­ting for her to s­pe­ak.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s very funny,” she said. “Very funny in­­deed!”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s the most ex­­tra­or­­di­­nary com­­mu­­ni­­ca­­ti­on I ha­­ve ever re­­cei­­ved,” he
re­­pli­ed wi­­th con­­vic­­ti­on. “You see it is writ­­ten from Cuya­­ba, Bra­­zil. The
da­­te is three mon­­ths ago to a day. Now I ha­­ve taken the trou­­ble to find
out whe­­re and what Cuya­­ba is.”</p>  <p>He ma­de this con­fes­si­on wi­th an air of cons­ci­ous pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
so, laid him­self back in his chair, stuck his thumbs in­to the arm­ho­les
of his waist­co­at, and lo­oked at his fair su­bor­di­na­te for ap­pro­val. Nor
was he des­ti­ned to be di­sap­po­in­ted. He was a ba­che­lor in pos­ses­si­on of a
snug in­co­me, and she, be­si­des being pretty, was a lady wi­th a keen eye
to the main ­chan­ce.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re   <em>is</em>  Cuya­ba?” she asked ­hum­bly.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Cuya­­ba,” he re­­pli­ed, rol­­ling his ton­­gue wi­­th con­­si­­de­­ra­­ble re­­lish round
his un­­cons­­ci­ous mis­­pro­­nun­­ci­a­­ti­on of the na­­me, “is a town al­­most on the
wes­­tern or Bo­­li­­vi­an bor­­der of Bra­­zil. It is of mo­­de­­ra­­te si­­ze, is
si­­tu­a­­ted on the banks of the ri­­ver Cuya­­ba, and is con­­si­­de­­ra­­bly con­­nec­­ted
wi­­th the fa­­mous Bra­­zi­­li­an Di­a­­mond ­­Fi­elds.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And do­es the wri­­ter of this let­­ter li­­ve ­­the­­re?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I can­­not say. He wri­­tes from the­­re—­­that is enough for us.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And he or­­ders din­­ner for four—­­he­­re, in a pri­­va­­te ro­om over­­lo­oking the
ri­­ver, three mon­­ths ahe­ad—­­punc­­tu­ally at eight o’­­clock, gi­­ves you a list
of the things he wants, and even ar­­ran­­ges the de­­co­­ra­­ti­on of the ta­­ble.
Says he has ne­­ver seen ei­­ther of his three fri­ends be­­fo­­re; that one of
them hails from (he­­re she con­­sul­­ted the let­­ter again) Hang-­­chow, ano­­ther
from Blo­em­­fon­­tein, whi­­le the third re­­si­­des, at pre­­sent, in En­­gland. Ea­­ch
one is to pre­­sent an or­­di­­nary vi­­si­­ting card wi­­th a red dot on it to the
por­­ter in the hall, and to be shown to the ro­om at on­­ce. I don’t
un­­ders­­tand it at all.”</p>  <p>The ma­na­ger pau­sed for a mo­ment, and then said de­li­be­ra­tely,—”­Hang-­chow
is in Chi­na, Blo­em­fon­tein is in Sou­th A­fri­ca.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>What a won­­der­­ful man you are, to be su­­re, Mr. McP­­her­­son! I ne­­ver can  <em>think</em>  how you ma­na­ge to carry so mu­ch in your ­he­ad.”</p>  <p>The­re spoke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the right di­rec­ti­on,
for the ma­na­ger was sus­cep­ti­ble to her gen­tle in­flu­en­ce, as she had
oc­ca­si­on to k­now.</p>  <p>At this junc­tu­re the he­ad wai­ter ap­pe­a­red upon the sce­ne, and to­ok up a
po­si­ti­on just in­si­de the do­orway, as if he we­re afraid of in­ju­ring the
car­pet by co­ming ­far­ther.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is No. 22 re­ady, Wil­­li­ams?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Qui­­te re­ady, sir. The wi­­ne is on the ice, and co­ok tells me he’ll be
re­ady to dish punc­­tu­al to the ­­mo­­ment.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The let­­ter says, ‘no elec­­tric ligh­t; cand­­les wi­­th red sha­­des.’ Ha­­ve you
put on tho­­se sha­­des I got this ­­mor­­ning?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Just seen it do­­ne this very mi­­nu­­te, ­­sir.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And let me see, the­­re was one other thing.” He to­ok the let­­ter from the
chi­ef bo­okkee­­per’s hand and glan­­ced at it. “A­h, yes, a por­­ce­­lain sau­­cer,
and a small jug of new milk upon the man­­tel­­pi­e­­ce. An ex­­tra­or­­di­­nary
re­­quest, but has it been at­­ten­­ded ­­to?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I put it the­­re my­­self, ­­sir.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Who wait?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Jo­­nes, Ed­­munds, Bro­oks, and ­­Tomkins.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Very go­od. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had bet­­ter tell the
hall por­­ter to lo­ok out for three gen­­tle­­men pre­­sen­­ting plain vi­­si­­ting
cards wi­­th a lit­­tle red spot on them. Let Bro­oks wait in the hall, and
when they ar­­ri­­ve tell him to show them straight up to the ­­ro­om.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It shall be do­­ne, ­­sir.”</p>  <p>The he­ad wai­ter left the ro­om, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched him­self in his
chair, yaw­ned by way of showing his im­por­tan­ce, and then said ­so­lemnly,—</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I don’t be­­li­e­­ve they’ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
Niko­­la, who­e­­ver he may be, won’t be able to find fault wi­­th my ar­­ran­­ge­­ments.”</p>  <p>Then, le­a­ving the dusty high ro­ad of Bu­si­ness, he and his com­pa­ni­on
wan­de­red in the shady brid­le-­pa­ths of Lo­ve—­to the end that when the
chi­ef bo­okkee­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
stran­ge din­ner party about to take pla­ce ups­tairs, and was bu­sily
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­ti­on as to how she would lo­ok in whi­te sa­tin and
oran­ge blos­soms, and, that set­tled, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it was
tru­e, as Miss Joy­ce, a su­bor­di­na­te, had been he­ard to de­cla­re, that the
ma­na­ger had on­ce shown him­self par­ti­al to a cer­tain wi­dow wi­th re­pu­ted
sa­vings and a sha­re in an ex­ten­si­ve egg and dairy ­bu­si­ness.</p>  <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to eight pre­ci­sely a han­som drew up at the steps of the
ho­tel. As so­on as it stop­ped, an un­der­si­zed gen­tle­man, wi­th a cle­an
sha­ven coun­te­nan­ce, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­ti­on, and bow legs, dres­sed in a
de­ci­dedly cle­ri­cal garb, aligh­ted. He paid and dis­char­ged his cab­man,
and then to­ok from his ticket pocket an or­di­nary whi­te vi­si­ting card,
whi­ch he pre­sen­ted to the gold-­la­ced in­di­vi­du­al who had ope­ned the
apron. The lat­ter, ha­ving no­ted the red spot, cal­led a wai­ter, and the
re­ve­rend gen­tle­man was im­me­di­a­tely es­cor­ted ups­tairs.</p>  <p>Hardly had the at­ten­dant ti­me to re­turn to his sta­ti­on in the hall,
be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pe­a­ran­ce, clo­sely fol­lowed by a third.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tall, ac­ti­ve, well-­built man of about thirty
ye­ars of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fashi­on, and
to con­ce­al it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wo­re a lar­ge In­ver­ness ca­pe of he­avy
tex­tu­re. He al­so in his turn han­ded a whi­te card to the por­ter, and,
ha­ving do­ne so, pro­cee­ded in­to the hall, fol­lowed by the oc­cu­pant of the
last cab, who had clo­sely co­pi­ed his exam­ple. This in­di­vi­du­al was al­so
in eve­ning dress, but it was of a dif­fe­rent stamp. It was old-­fashi­o­ned
and had seen mu­ch use. The we­a­rer, to­o, was tal­ler than the or­di­nary run
of men, whi­le it was no­ti­ce­a­ble that his hair was snow-w­hi­te, and that
his fa­ce was dee­ply pit­ted wi­th small­pox. Af­ter dis­po­sing of their hats
and co­ats in an an­te-­ro­om, they re­a­ched ro­om No. 22, whe­re they found
the gen­tle­man in cle­ri­cal cos­tu­me pa­cing im­pa­ti­en­tly up and ­down.</p>  <p>Left alo­ne, the tal­lest of the tri­o, who for want of a bet­ter ti­tle we
may call the Best Dres­sed Man, to­ok out his wat­ch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
it, lo­oked at his com­pa­ni­ons. “Gen­tle­men,” he said, wi­th a slight
Ame­ri­can ac­cent, “it is three mi­nu­tes to eight o’­clock. My na­me is E­as­to­ver!”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m glad to he­ar it, for I’m most un­­com­­monly hun­­gry,” said the next
tal­­lest, whom I ha­­ve al­­re­ady des­­cri­­bed as being so marked by di­­se­a­­se.
“My na­­me is ­­Pren­­der­­gast!”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>We only wait for our fri­end and host,” re­­marked the cle­­ri­­cal gen­­tle­­man,
as if he felt he ought to take a sha­­re in the con­­ver­­sa­­ti­on, and then, as
an af­­ter­­though­t, he con­­ti­­nu­ed, “My na­­me is ­­Bax­­ter!”</p>  <p>They sho­ok hands all round wi­th marked cor­di­a­lity, se­a­ted them­sel­ves
again, and to­ok it in turns to exa­mi­ne the ­clock.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you ever had the ple­a­­su­­re of mee­­ting our host be­­fo­­re?” asked Mr.
Bax­­ter of Mr. ­­Pren­­der­­gast.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ne­­ver,” re­­pli­ed that gen­­tle­­man, wi­­th a shake of his he­ad. “Per­­haps Mr.
Eas­­to­­ver has been mo­­re ­­for­­tu­­na­­te?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Not I,” was the bri­ef re­­jo­in­­der. “I’­­ve had to do wi­­th him off and on
for lon­­ger than I ca­­re to reckon, but I’­­ve ne­­ver set eyes on him up to ­­da­­te.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re may he ha­­ve been the first ti­­me you he­ard from ­­him?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In Nashvil­­le, Ten­­nes­­see,” said Eas­­to­­ver. “Af­­ter that, Ta­­hu­­pa­­pa, New
Ze­a­­land; af­­ter that, Pa­­pee­­te, in the So­­ci­ety Is­­lands; then Pekin, Chi­­na.
And you?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>First ti­­me, Brus­­sels; se­­cond, Mon­­te Vi­­de­o; third, Man­­da­­lay, and then
the Gold Co­ast, Afri­­ca. It’s your turn, Mr. ­­Bax­­ter.”</p>  <p>The clergy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­pi­e­ce. It was exac­tly eight o’­clock.
“First ti­me, Ca­bul, Afg­ha­nis­tan; se­cond, Nij­ni Nov­go­rod, Rus­si­a; third,
Wil­can­ni­a, Dar­ling Ri­ver, Aus­tra­li­a; four­th, Val­pa­rai­so, Chi­li; fif­th,
Na­ga­saki, ­Ja­pan.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is evi­­den­­tly a gre­at tra­­vel­­ler and a most mys­­te­­ri­ous ­­per­­son.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is mo­­re than that,” said Eas­­to­­ver wi­­th con­­vic­­ti­on; “he is la­­te for ­­din­­ner!”</p>  <p>Pren­der­gast lo­oked at his wat­ch.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That clock is two mi­­nu­­tes fast. Hark, the­­re go­es Big Ben! Eigh­t e­­xac­­tly.”</p>  <p>As he spoke the do­or was thrown open and a voi­ce an­noun­ced “Dr. ­Niko­la.”</p>  <p>The three men sprang to their feet si­mul­ta­ne­ously, wi­th ex­cla­ma­ti­ons of
as­to­nishment, as the man they had been dis­cus­sing ma­de his ap­pe­a­ran­ce.</p>  <p>It would take mo­re ti­me than I can spa­re the sub­ject to gi­ve you an
ade­qua­te and in­clu­si­ve des­crip­ti­on of the per­son who en­te­red the ro­om at
that mo­ment. In sta­tu­re he was sligh­tly abo­ve the or­di­nary, his
shoul­ders we­re bro­ad, his limbs per­fec­tly sha­ped and plainly mus­cu­lar,
but very slim. His he­ad, whi­ch was mag­ni­fi­cen­tly set upon his shoul­ders,
was ador­ned wi­th a pro­fu­si­on of glossy black hair; his fa­ce was
des­ti­tu­te of be­ard or mous­ta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and hand­so­me
moul­ding; whi­le his skin was of a dark oli­ve hu­e, a co­lour whi­ch
har­mo­ni­zed well wi­th his pi­er­cing black eyes and pe­arly tee­th. His hands
and feet we­re small, and the gre­a­test dandy must ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he
was ir­re­pro­a­cha­bly dres­sed, wi­th a ne­at­ness that bor­de­red on the
pu­ri­ta­ni­cal. In age he might ha­ve been any­thing from eigh­t-and-twenty to
forty; in re­a­lity he was thirty-­three. He ad­van­ced in­to the ro­om and
walked wi­th out-s­tret­ched hand di­rec­tly across to whe­re Eas­to­ver was
stan­ding by the ­fi­re­pla­ce.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Mr. Eas­­to­­ver, I feel cer­­tain,” he said, fi­­xing his glit­­te­­ring eyes upon
the man he ad­­dres­­sed, and al­­lowing a cu­­ri­ous smi­­le to play upon his ­­fa­­ce.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That is my na­­me, Dr. Niko­­la,” the other answe­­red wi­­th evi­­dent sur­­pri­­se.
“But how on ear­­th can you dis­­tin­­guish me from your other ­­guests?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ah! it would sur­­pri­­se you if you knew. And Mr. Pren­­der­­gast, and Mr.
Bax­­ter. This is de­­ligh­t­­ful; I ho­­pe I am not la­­te. We had a col­­li­­si­on in
the Chan­­nel this mor­­ning, and I was al­­most afraid I might not be up to
ti­­me. Din­­ner seems re­ady; shall we sit down to it?” They se­a­­ted
them­­sel­­ves, and the me­al com­­men­­ced. The Im­­pe­­ri­al Res­­tau­­rant has ear­­ned
an en­­vi­a­­ble re­­pu­­ta­­ti­on for do­ing things well, and the din­­ner that night
did not in any way de­­tract from its lus­­tre. But, de­­ligh­t­­ful as it all
was, it was no­­ti­­ce­a­­ble that the three guests paid mo­­re at­­ten­­ti­on to
their host than to his ex­­cel­­lent   <em>me­nu</em>. As they had said be­fo­re his
ar­ri­val, they had all had de­a­lings wi­th him for se­ve­ral ye­ars, but what
tho­se de­a­lings we­re they we­re ca­re­ful not to des­cri­be. It was mo­re than
pos­si­ble that they hardly liked to re­mem­ber them ­them­sel­ves.</p>  <p>When cof­fee had been ser­ved and the ser­vants had wi­thdrawn, Dr. Niko­la
ro­se from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­bo­ard. On it
sto­od a basket of very cu­ri­ous sha­pe and work­manship. This he ope­ned,
and as he did so, to the as­to­nishment of his guests, an enor­mous cat, as
black as his mas­ter’s co­at, le­a­ped out on to the flo­or. The re­a­son for
the sau­cer and jug of milk be­ca­me e­vi­dent.</p>  <p>Se­a­ting him­self at the ta­ble again, the host fol­lowed the exam­ple of his
guests and lit a ci­gar, blowing a cloud of smoke lu­xu­ri­ously through his
de­li­ca­tely chi­sel­led nos­trils. His eyes wan­de­red round the cor­ni­ce of
the ro­om, to­ok in the pic­tu­res and de­co­ra­ti­ons, and then ca­me down to
meet the fa­ces of his com­pa­ni­ons. As they did so, the black cat, ha­ving
fi­nished its me­al, sprang on to his shoul­der to crou­ch the­re, wat­ching
the three men through the cur­ling smoke drift wi­th its green blinking,
fi­en­dish eyes. Dr. Niko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal had
upon his ­guests.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Now shall we get to bu­­si­­ness?” he said ­­briskly.</p>  <p>The others al­most si­mul­ta­ne­ously knocked the ashes off their ci­gars and
brought them­sel­ves to at­ten­ti­on. Dr. Niko­la’s dainty, lan­guid man­ner
see­med to drop from him like a clo­ak, his eyes brigh­te­ned, and his
voi­ce, when he spoke, was cle­an cut as chi­sel­led ­sil­ver.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You are doub­­tless an­­xi­ous to be in­­for­­med why I sum­­mo­­ned you from all
parts of the glo­­be to meet me he­­re to-­­nigh­t? And it is very na­­tu­­ral you
should be. But then, from what you know of me, you should not be
sur­­pri­­sed at any­­thing I ­­do.”</p>  <p>His voi­ce drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gen­tle lan­guor. He drew in a
gre­at bre­a­th of smoke and then sent it slowly out from his lips again.
His eyes we­re half clo­sed, and he drum­med wi­th one fin­ger on the ta­ble
ed­ge. The cat lo­oked through the smoke at the three men, and it see­med
to them that he grew every mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fe­ro­ci­ous. Pre­sen­tly
his ow­ner to­ok him from his per­ch, and se­a­ting him on his knee fell to
stroking his fur, from he­ad to tail, wi­th his long slim fin­gers. It was
as if he we­re drawing ins­pi­ra­ti­on for so­me de­adly mis­chi­ef from the
un­canny ­be­ast.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>To pre­­fa­­ce what I ha­­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by
far the most im­­por­­tant bu­­si­­ness for whi­­ch I ha­­ve ever re­­qui­­red your
help. (Three slow strokes down the cen­­tre of the back, and one round
ea­­ch ear.) When it first ca­­me in­­to my mind I was at a loss who to trust
in the mat­­ter. I thought of Ven­­don, but I found Ven­­don was de­ad. I
thought of Brown­­low, but Brown­­low was no lon­­ger fai­­thful. (Two strokes
down the back and two on the thro­at.) Then bit by bit I re­­mem­­be­­red you.
I was in Bra­­zil at the ti­­me. So I sent for you. You ca­­me. So far so ­­go­od.”</p>  <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­re­pla­ce. As he went the cat craw­led
back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­ti­on on his shoul­der. Then his voi­ce chan­ged
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer bu­si­ness-­like ­to­ne.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am not go­ing to tell you very mu­­ch about it. But from what I do tell
you, you will be able to ga­­ther a gre­at de­al and ima­­gi­­ne the rest. To
be­­gin wi­­th, the­­re is a man li­­ving in this world to-­­day who has do­­ne me a
gre­at and las­­ting in­­jury. What that in­­jury is is no con­­cern of yours.
You would not un­­ders­­tand if I told you. So we’ll le­a­­ve that out of the
ques­­ti­on. He is im­­men­­sely ri­­ch. His che­­que for £300,000 would be
ho­­nou­­red by his bank at any mi­­nu­­te. Ob­­vi­ously he is a power. He has had
re­a­­son to know that I am pit­­ting my wits against his, and he flat­­ters
him­­self that so far he has got the bet­­ter of me. That is be­­cau­­se I am
drawing him on. I am ma­­tu­­ring a plan whi­­ch will make him a po­or and a
very mi­­se­­ra­­ble man at one and the sa­­me ti­­me. If that sche­­me suc­­ceeds,
and I am sa­­tis­­fi­ed wi­­th the way you three men ha­­ve per­­for­­med the parts I
shall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to ea­­ch of you the sum of
£10,000. If it do­esn’t suc­­ceed, then you will ea­­ch re­­cei­­ve a thou­­sand
and your ex­­pen­­ses. Do you fol­­low ­­me?”</p>  <p>It was evi­dent from their fa­ces that they hung upon his every word.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>But, re­­mem­­ber, I de­­mand from you your who­­le and en­­ti­­re la­­bour. Whi­­le
you are ser­­ving me you are mi­­ne body and soul. I know you are
trustwor­­thy. I ha­­ve had go­od pro­of that you are—­­par­­don the
ex­­pres­­si­on—uns­­cru­­pu­­lous, and I flat­­ter my­­self you are si­­lent. What is
mo­­re, I shall tell you no­­thing beyond what is ne­­ces­­sary for the carrying
out of my sche­­me, so that you could not be­­tray me if you would. Now for
my ­­plans!”</p>  <p>He sat down again and to­ok a pa­per from his pocket. Ha­ving pe­ru­sed it,
he tur­ned to E­as­to­ver.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You will le­a­­ve at on­­ce—­­that is to say, by the bo­at on Wed­­nes­­day—­­for
Syd­­ney. You will bo­ok your pas­­sa­­ge to-­­mor­­row mor­­ning, first thing, and
join her in Ply­­mou­­th. You will meet me to-­­mor­­row eve­­ning at an ad­­dress I
will send you, and re­­cei­­ve your fi­­nal ins­­truc­­ti­ons. ­­Go­od-­­nigh­t.”</p>  <p>Seeing that he was ex­pec­ted to go, Eas­to­ver ro­se, sho­ok hands, and left
the ro­om wi­thout a word. He was too as­to­nished to he­si­ta­te or to say any­thing.</p>  <p>Niko­la to­ok ano­ther let­ter from his pocket and tur­ned to Pren­der­gast.
“<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to-­nigh­t, cross to Pa­ris to-­mor­row mor­ning,
and le­a­ve this let­ter per­so­nally at the ad­dress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thurs­day, at half-­past two pre­ci­sely, you will de­li­ver me an
answer in the por­ch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­ci­ent mo­ney in
that en­ve­lo­pe to pay all your ex­pen­ses. Now ­go!”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>At half-­­past two you shall ha­­ve your answer. ­­Go­od-­­nigh­t.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Go­od-­­nigh­t.”</p>  <p>When Pren­der­gast had left the ro­om, Dr. Niko­la lit ano­ther ci­gar and
tur­ned his at­ten­ti­ons to Mr. ­Bax­ter.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Six mon­­ths ago, Mr. Bax­­ter, I found for you a si­­tu­a­­ti­on as tu­­tor to the
young Mar­­quis of Becke­­nham. You still hold it, I ­­sup­­po­­se?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ­­do.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is the fa­­ther well dis­­po­­sed towards you?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In every way. I ha­­ve do­­ne my best to in­­gra­­ti­a­­te my­­self wi­­th him. That
was one of your ins­­truc­­ti­ons.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Yes, yes! But I was not cer­­tain that you would suc­­ceed. If the old man
is any­­thing like what he was when I last met him he must still be a
dif­­fi­­cult per­­son to de­al wi­­th. Do­es the boy like you?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ho­­pe ­­so.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you brought me his pho­­to­­graph as I ­­di­­rec­­ted?”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ha­­ve. He­­re it is.”</p>  <p>Bax­ter to­ok a pho­to­graph from his pocket and han­ded it across the ­ta­ble.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Go­od. You ha­­ve do­­ne very well, Mr. Bax­­ter. I am ple­a­­sed wi­­th you.
To-­­mor­­row mor­­ning you will go back to Yorkshi­­re——”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I beg your par­­don, Bour­­ne­­mou­­th. His Gra­­ce owns a hou­­se ne­ar
Bour­­ne­­mou­­th, whi­­ch he oc­­cu­­pi­es du­­ring the sum­­mer ­­mon­­ths.”</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Very well—­­then to-­­mor­­row mor­­ning you will go back to Bour­­ne­­mou­­th and
con­­ti­­nue to in­­gra­­ti­a­­te your­­self wi­­th fa­­ther and son. You will al­­so be­­gin
to im­­plant in the boy’s mind a de­­si­­re for tra­­vel. Don’t let him be­­co­­me
awa­­re that his de­­si­­re has its sour­­ce in you—­­but do not fail to fos­­ter
it all you can. I will com­­mu­­ni­­ca­­te wi­­th you fur­­ther in a day or two. Now ­­go.”</p>  <p>Bax­ter in his turn left the ro­om. The do­or clo­sed. Dr. Niko­la picked up
the pho­to­graph and stu­di­ed it.</p>  <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The like­­ness is un­­mis­­taka­­ble—or it ought to be. My fri­end, my very
de­ar fri­end, We­­the­­rell, my toi­ls are clo­­sing on you. My ar­­ran­­ge­­ments are
per­­fec­­ting them­­sel­­ves ad­­mi­­ra­­bly. Pre­­sen­­tly, when all is com­­ple­­te, I
shall press the le­­ver, the ma­­chi­­nery will be set in mo­­ti­on, and you will
find your­­self being slowly but su­­rely ground in­­to pow­­der. Then you will
hand over what I want, and be sorry you thought fit to baulk Dr. ­­Niko­­la!”</p>  <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This duty dis­char­ged, he pla­ced
the cat back in its pri­son, shut the lid, des­cen­ded wi­th the basket to
the hall, and cal­led a han­som. The por­ter in­qui­red to what ad­dress he
should or­der the cab­man to dri­ve. Dr. Niko­la did not re­ply for a mo­ment,
then he said, as if he had been thinking so­me­thing out: “The  <em>Green
Sai­lor</em>  pu­blic-­hou­se, East In­dia Dock ­Ro­ad.”</p>  <hr class="docutils">
